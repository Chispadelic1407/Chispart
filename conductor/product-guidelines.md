## Tone and Voice

### Overall Voice: Approachable and Modern

The catalog strikes a balance between technical credibility and accessibility, making it welcoming to both technical and non-technical audiences.

#### Voice Characteristics

**Professional Yet Friendly**

- Let the live demos speak for themselves
- Use "built," "created," "developed" rather than "mastered" or "perfected"

**Inclusive and Welcoming**
- Use "we" and "let's" to create partnership feeling
- Avoid gatekeeping technical language
- Provide context for technical terms when necessary

**Action-Oriented**
- Focus on what projects *do* and *solve*, not just what they *are*
- Use active voice: "This app helps users..." not "Users are helped by..."
- Emphasize outcomes and real-world applications
